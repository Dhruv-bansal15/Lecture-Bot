# Lecture-Bot

In India, due to the pandemic COVID-19 situation, our college started conducting online classes. A lot of people soon started forgetting about the lectures and end up getting low attendance.

Even though online classes could be attended from anywhere in the world, this became a negative aspect for many people as now they were carefree and forgot to join these classes in the first place.
So, we came up with a solution of a reminder system, wherein our bot sends reminder mails on the fed e-mail address.

This product is targeted to all such students and employees who need to attend classes in the online mode and tend to miss them due to carelessness.

## The main objectives of this product are-

- Benefit people to join their online meets timely
- Help in maintaining a log of their online classes
- Reduce last moment stress to join meets by sending the meet link along with the reminder 10 minutes prior to the class

## Why would you want to use our product?

In today’s world, when we use our mobiles to use social media for a lot of time but still don’t have the time to set reminders for our meetings and classes, our app would provide you with a one stop solution to end your worries.
Once started, our bot will send you e-mail notifications along with the meet link to join the class.

Identification of the cause of the problem can be seen from the problems in the process of obtaining lecture information that is still not organized in a single application system, so the design of the application is very necessary to maximize the process of obtaining lecture information.

This is intended to facilitate the fulfilment of lecture information needs using e-mail reminder bot.
